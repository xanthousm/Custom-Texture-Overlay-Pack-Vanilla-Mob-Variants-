# Custom Texture Overlay Pack [Vanilla Mob Variants]
Though the textures that come with Vanilla Mob Variants are great, there is already a HUGE amount of textures that have been made by much more talented people for other packs, especially for java where variant textures is made possible with optifine.

So to make these textures usable while not doing any unpermitted sharing, this resource pack allows you replace the textures in Vanilla Mob Variants with textures that you have for personal use!

### HOW TO USE:
- replace the textures in the "v" and "c" folders for each entity
	- just deleting the texture will not change anything. Instead, replace the texture with a duplicate
	- using duplicate textures will make that texture more common
	- make sure the texture names match, since the pack is only looking for those specific names
- activate the Vanilla Mob Variants pack and choose a pack setting by clicking the pack's gear icon
	- textures in the "v" folder will be used in all pack options except "pure vanilla"
	- textures in the "c" folder will only be used in the "custom" pack option
- activate this pack ON TOP of Vanilla Mob Variants in the pack selection panel

When both this pack and Vanilla Mob Variants are active, you may have to reset minecraft to make any changes appeear, so its easier to disable both pack before making changes, then re-enabling them again.

### DO NOT SHARE TEXTURE FILES THAT YOU DONT HAVE PERMISSION FOR
Sharie the source link for a texture instead. It isn't very hard, and it helps the texture creator know that people are appreciating their work!

Have fun with your custom textures!
